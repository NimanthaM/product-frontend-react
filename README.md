## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** >= 16.0.0 (includes npm)
- **Git**

### Check if you have Node.js installed:
```powershell
node --version
npm --version
```

**This project uses Node.js v22.16.0**

If you don't have Node.js, download it from: https://nodejs.org/

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```powershell
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd product-frontend-react
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

This will install all required packages (156 packages) including React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Axios:

```powershell
npm install
```

**Expected Output:**
```
added 155 packages, and audited 156 packages in 31s
30 packages are looking for funding
```

**Note**: Dependencies are already installed for this project.

### Step 3: Configure API URL

The application is already configured to connect to the Laravel backend at `http://localhost:8000/api`.

If your backend is running on a different URL, edit the `src/services/api.js` file:

```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:8000/api'; // Change this if needed
```

### Step 4: Start the Development Server

Open PowerShell in the project directory and run:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

**Expected Output:**
```
VITE v5.4.21  ready in 413 ms

➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
➜  Network: use --host to expose
➜  press h + enter to show help
```

✅ **The application is now running at:** `http://localhost:3000`

The browser may automatically open. If not, manually navigate to http://localhost:3000

**Keep this PowerShell window open!** The server will stop if you close it.

## 📡 Connecting to Backend

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: The frontend will NOT work without the backend running!

### Before starting the frontend:

1. **Start MySQL in XAMPP Control Panel**
   - Open XAMPP Control Panel
   - Click "Start" next to MySQL (if not already running)

2. **Open a PowerShell window** and navigate to backend directory:
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Users\Nima's TUF\Desktop\Aahaas Ecommerce\product-api-laravel"
   ```

3. **Start the Laravel server:**
   ```powershell
   C:\xampp\php\php.exe artisan serve
   ```
   
4. **Verify backend is running:** Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products in your browser
   - You should see JSON data with 8 products

5. **Open a NEW PowerShell window** and start the frontend:
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Users\Nima's TUF\Desktop\Aahaas Ecommerce\product-frontend-react"
   npm run dev
   ```

**Keep BOTH PowerShell windows open** while using the application!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Error Loading Products" or blank page
**Solution**: 
1. **Verify backend is running:** Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products in browser
   - Should show JSON data, not an error
2. Make sure MySQL is running in XAMPP Control Panel
3. Check both PowerShell windows are still open
4. Press F12 in browser and check Console tab for errors
5. Click "Try Again" button or refresh the page

### Issue: "Cannot connect to backend"
**Solution**: 
1. Backend must run on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (not localhost:8000)
2. Restart Laravel server: `C:\xampp\php\php.exe artisan serve`
3. Check backend terminal for errors
4. Verify `src/services/api.js` has correct URL

### Issue: "npm install fails"
**Solution**:
```powershell
# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Delete node_modules and package-lock.json
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules, package-lock.json

# Reinstall
npm install
```

### Issue: "Port 3000 already in use"
**Solution**: 
```powershell
# Kill the process using port 3000
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
# Note the PID number, then:
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Or start on different port
npm run dev -- --port 3001
```

### Issue: Frontend stops when closing terminal
**Solution**: This is normal. The dev server must stay running. Keep the PowerShell window open or minimize it.

### Issue: Images not loading
**Solution**: 
- Images use Unsplash URLs which require internet connection
- If images fail to load, a placeholder is automatically shown
- Check your internet connection

### Issue: Styles not applying
**Solution**:
```bash
# Rebuild Tailwind CSS
npm run dev
```
